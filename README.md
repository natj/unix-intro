Very simple & basic introduction to UNIX
========================================

> UNIX is an operating system developed already in the 1960s for the very first computers.
> By operating system we mean a suite of programs that make the computer work.
> UNIX systems are characterized by being stable, multi-user and multi-tasking systems for servers, desktops and laptops.
> Because of this, UNIX commands can be found everywhere from supercomputers to Apple laptops.
> For a researcher it is an invaluable tool as everything can be automated simplifying your life a whole bunch!




> From the power user's or programmer's perspective, Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy", meaning that the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each perform a limited, well-defined function, with a unified filesystem as the main means of communication and a shell scripting and command language to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.
