Simple & basic introduction to UNIX
========================================

UNIX is an operating system developed already in the 1960s to be used with the early computers of the time.
By operating system we mean a suite of programs that make the computer work.
UNIX systems are characterized by being stable, multi-user and multi-tasking systems for servers, desktops and laptops.
Because of this, UNIX commands can be found everywhere from supercomputers to Apple laptops.
For a researcher it is an invaluable tool as everything can be automated simplifying your life a whole bunch!

UNIX systems incorporate a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy", meaning that the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each perform a limited, well-defined function.
In addition, with the unified filesystem as the main mean of communication and a shell scripting to aid you, the system can perform complex workflows with ease.
